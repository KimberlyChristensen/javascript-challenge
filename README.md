# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Overview
This project involved creating code that creates a table dynamically based on provided data.  The user is able to filter the table data for specific values. The code involves the use of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
* A basic HTML web page was created.
* The code appends a table to the webpage and adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting in the provided data.
* Columns include:  `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`

## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* In addition to the specifications for Level 1, this JavaScript code involves using multiple `input` tags to allow the user to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
